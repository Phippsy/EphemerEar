# Welcome to ephemerear ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This is a basic chat interface which you can use to correspond with your ephemerear.

Message history is not currently shown, but the bot will remember any conversations you've had previously, up to the maximum token limit you've allocated for your conversations. Edit `bot.max_message_window` in your `config.yaml` file to alter the maximum token window for each interaction with your bot.
